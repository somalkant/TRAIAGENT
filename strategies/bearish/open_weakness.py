"""
Open Weakness — stock opens near prior day low on a weak Nifty.

Stock opens within 0.5% of its previous day's low AND the first 15-min
candle (9:15–9:30) makes a new low AND Nifty 50 is also down >0.3%.

Short immediately after first 15-min close (9:30 bar).
Stop: above opening price.
Target: 1.5× stop distance below entry.

Logic: stocks that cannot hold the prior day's low on a weak open have
sustained institutional selling from pre-market, not just retail panic.
