## Year 2016 Summary
- Total trades : 693  (238 trading days, max 3/day)
- Win rate     : 30.2%
- Total P&L    : Rs 10,11,970

### Strategy Weights after 2016
| Strategy        | Weight | Verdict     | Note                                      |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| VOL-SPIKE       |   3.00 | BEST        | >60% win rate — volume at resistance works in 2016 |
| NR7             |   1.00 | NEUTRAL     | 40–60% win rate or too few signals        |
| GAP-FADE        |   0.10 | SUPPRESSED  | <30% win rate — fading gaps burned in 2016 trend |
| All others (19) |   0.50 | REDUCED     | 30–40% win rate — strategies active but underperforming |

**Key insight:** Only VOL-SPIKE crossed the 60% win-rate threshold in 2016.
GAP-FADE hit minimum weight — 2016 gap-ups mostly continued rather than fading.
All other strategies at 0.5 — performance was marginal, weights will adapt as more years load.

## Cross-Year Analysis — 10 Statements to Carry Forward

*Derived from 8 years of sequential backtesting (2016–2023), 4,869 trades, Rs 2.40Cr total P&L.*  
*These are data-backed conclusions — not assumptions. Treat them as axioms for future sessions.*

---

### STATEMENT 1 — VOL-SPIKE is the only all-weather strategy
**VOL-SPIKE crossed 60% win rate in every single year without exception: 2016→BEST, 2017→72%, 2018→84%, 2019→76%, 2020→63%, 2021→73%, 2022→75%, 2023→69%.**  
No other strategy comes close to this consistency across bull, bear, and sideways years.  
**Rule:** When VOL-SPIKE fires, always select it as driver. Never override it for a lower-lifetime-win-rate strategy. Its conviction tier is HIGH (2× risk) and this is justified by 8 years of evidence.

---

### STATEMENT 2 — VWAP-REV is critically underweighted by the adaptive system
**VWAP-REV achieved 53–77% win rate in 6 of 7 measured years, yet its frozen weight is only 0.19 (second-lowest).**  
The adaptive system suppressed it because it generates fewer signals than volume-heavy strategies — 50 tracked signals take longer to accumulate for a selective strategy.  
**Rule:** Do NOT judge VWAP-REV by its weight. Judge it by lifetime win rate (61.8%). When VWAP-REV fires alongside any one qualifying strategy, it is a HIGH-quality signal regardless of the 0.19 weight. In Phase 2, it qualifies for MEDIUM conviction tier (1.5× risk).

---

### STATEMENT 3 — EMA-CROSS must never be a driver and must be excluded from agreement count
**EMA-CROSS win rate by year: 2017→44%, 2018→40%, 2019→39%, 2020→26%, 2021→30%, 2022→29%, 2023→29%. It has never cleared 50% in any learning year.**  
Lifetime win rate: 34.7% — the lowest of all 27 strategies.  
**Rule:** EMA-CROSS is already excluded from the agreement filter (lifetime win% < 50%). If it ever fires as the only signal, the trade must be rejected at quality filter. It contributes nothing to signal quality — only noise.

---

### STATEMENT 4 — The system's effective win rate floor is 57%, proven across 7 years
**Effective win rate by year: 2017→58.6%, 2018→58.1%, 2019→57.1%, 2020→57.2%, 2021→63.3%, 2022→58.9%, 2023→59.2%.**  
The range is 57–63% across bull (2019, 2021), bear (2022), COVID crash (2020), and sideways (2018) markets.  
**Rule:** If effective win rate in any testing year drops below 55% over a rolling 3-month window, this is a regime signal requiring investigation — not a strategy failure. Frozen weights may need re-evaluation or a manual regime override.

---

### STATEMENT 5 — GAP strategies behave differently and must be treated independently
**GAP-CONT win rate: 2017→59%, 2019→52%, 2020→55%, 2021→40%, 2022→66%, 2023→67% — reliable in most years.**  
**GAP-FADE win rate: 2017→71%, 2018→45%, 2019→48%, 2020→56%, 2021→48%, 2022→50%, 2023→48% — highly regime-dependent.**  
GAP-FADE works when gaps are genuinely overextended in a mean-reverting market (2017, 2020). It burns in trending years (2018, 2019 partial) where gap-ups continue.  
**Rule:** GAP-CONT (weight 1.27) can be trusted as a supporting strategy year-round. GAP-FADE should only drive a trade when ADX < 20 and the broader market is in a consolidation phase — not during strong momentum.

### STATEMENT 6 — Chart patterns are emerging as the highest-quality signal group
**Chart patterns first appeared in 2021. DBL-BTM: 55%→61%→50%. ASC-TRI: 58%→48%→52%. BULL-FLAG: 50%→51%→63%.**  
BULL-FLAG has improved every year since introduction and hit 63% in 2023 — higher than most legacy strategies.  
**Rule:** Chart patterns (DBL-BTM, ASC-TRI, BULL-FLAG) fire rarely but with above-average precision. When a chart pattern is the driver, the target is a measured move — historically these are reached more often than momentum targets. Prioritise chart patterns in the driver selection for 2024 when they compete with lower-confidence strategies.

### STATEMENT 7 — RSI-EXT is the most underrated mid-tier strategy
**RSI-EXT win rate: 2017→57%, 2018→66%, 2019→52%, 2020→57%, 2021→48%, 2022→68%, 2023→57%. Five of seven years above 55%.**  
One weak year (2021: 48%) dropped its weight to 0.84 — the adaptive system over-penalised it.  
Lifetime win rate: 58.0% — higher than ADX-FILTER, GAP-CONT, ORB strategies, yet weighted lower.  
**Rule:** RSI-EXT qualifies for MEDIUM conviction tier (1.5× risk). When RSI-EXT fires as driver alongside VWAP-REV or VOL-SPIKE, this is a high-quality mean-reversion setup. Do not discard it simply because it had one bad year.

---

### STATEMENT 8 — SUPERTREND is structurally broken and should be excluded from agreement count
**SUPERTREND win rate: 2018→42%, 2019→33%, 2020→48%, 2021→24% (worst strategy that year), 2022→41%, 2023→35%. Lifetime: 38.2%.**  
It has never exceeded 50% in any measured year. Unlike EMA-CROSS which occasionally has momentum years, SUPERTREND has no redemption year in 8 years of data.  
**Rule:** SUPERTREND should be added to the exclusion list alongside EMA-CROSS in the agreement filter. Its 38.2% lifetime win rate means it is a net negative contributor to agreement conviction. Even if the code has not yet been changed, mentally exclude it when reviewing signals.

---

### STATEMENT 9 — 2019 P&L was an anomaly, not a benchmark
**2019 P&L: Rs 1.36 Crore — 5× to 7× every other year (average of other years: Rs 20–27L).**  
2019 was a strong bull year (Nifty +12%) where breakout targets were routinely exceeded. The measured-move targets of ORB and chart patterns kept getting hit, compounding to an exceptional result.  
**Rule:** Do not design the system expecting 2019-level returns. The realistic annual P&L target is Rs 18–28L (based on 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022 averages) on Rs 10L capital. 2023 testing shows Rs 4.15L on just 245 trades — annualised on the full trade count that scales correctly.

---

### STATEMENT 10 — The frozen weights entering Phase 2 (testing) have known biases
**Entering 2023 with frozen weights, three distortions are known:**  
① VWAP-REV weight = 0.19 despite 61.8% lifetime win — systematically undersized.  
② VOL-SPIKE weight = 3.00 (capped) and well-earned — no distortion.  
③ SUPERTREND weight = 0.25 — still too high given 38.2% lifetime record.  

**Rule for 2024 and beyond:** The conviction tier system (HIGH/MEDIUM/STANDARD based on lifetime win rate, not frozen weight) was introduced specifically to correct weight distortions. When frozen weight and lifetime win rate conflict, the conviction tier is the more reliable signal. VWAP-REV at 0.19 weight is still MEDIUM conviction (61.8% lifetime). VOL-SPIKE at 3.00 weight is HIGH conviction (73.8% lifetime). These two numbers will always agree.

### 2023 Paper Trade Analysis — 7 Key Statements

**STATEMENT A — Frozen weights generalised perfectly to unseen data**  
The system achieved 59.2% effective win rate in 2023 with weights frozen at end-of-2022 — matching the 7-year learning average (57–63%) without any adaptation. The loss rate (40.8%) is identical to learning years (40–43%).  
**Conclusion:** The learned weights are not overfitted. The strategy is structurally sound for 2024+ testing under the same frozen weights.

**STATEMENT B — BULL-FLAG and ADX-FILTER are the breakthrough strategies of 2023**  
BULL-FLAG hit 63% in 2023 (up from 50% in 2021 → 51% in 2022 → 63% in 2023) — three consecutive years of improvement. ADX-FILTER hit 63% (up from 55% in 2022). Both outperformed their lifetime averages in the first forward-only test year.  
**Conclusion for 2024:** When BULL-FLAG or ADX-FILTER fires as driver alongside 2+ agreeing strategies, treat this as a strong signal. Both have demonstrated they work on unseen data.

**STATEMENT C — ORB strategies declined sharply in 2023 and need scrutiny**  
ORB-15: 59% in 2022 → 48% in 2023. ORB-30: 60% in 2022 → 50% in 2023. Both dropped ~10pp in the first forward-only year.  
**Interpretation:** 2023 had choppier opening sessions (global rate hike uncertainty, FII selling in early 2023). The standard 2× opening-range measured-move target may be too aggressive for low-momentum opens.  
**Rule for 2024:** When ORB is the driver and the first 15-minute candle is small (range < 0.5% of stock price), flag as lower-confidence. Consider only taking ORB signals when confirmed by at least 3 agreeing strategies, not the minimum 2.

**STATEMENT D — TIME_EXIT profitable rate of 22.9% is the highest in 8 years — targets are slightly ambitious**  
The system exited at TIME_EXIT with a profit in 56 out of 245 trades (22.9%) — higher than any learning year (average 17–21%). This means trades were moving in the right direction but not reaching the full predicted target before 15:15.  
**Interpretation:** 2023 market lacked the intraday follow-through momentum of 2019–2021. Measured-move targets were valid but took longer to reach.  
**Rule for 2024:** A TIME_EXIT with profit is still a WIN. If TIME_EXIT profitable rate stays above 20%, it is not a system flaw — it is the market taking longer. Do not tighten stops to force faster exits.

**STATEMENT E — FALL-WEDGE is in a confirmed multi-year decline and should be downgraded**  
FALL-WEDGE win rate: 2021→55.2%, 2022→41%, 2023→38%. Three consecutive years of decline, now below the 50% agreement threshold.  
**Conclusion:** FALL-WEDGE should be moved to the exclusion list (alongside EMA-CROSS and SUPERTREND) for the agreement filter. At 38%, it is a net negative vote. It generated 50 signals per year, so its inclusion was diluting signal quality. Flag this for review after 2024 run — if it stays below 40%, remove it permanently from agreement counting.

**STATEMENT F — GAP-CONT at 67% in 2023 is its best performance in 8 years**  
GAP-CONT win rate history: 2017→59%, 2019→52%, 2020→55%, 2021→40%, 2022→66%, 2023→67%. The last two years are a clear upward inflection.  
**Interpretation:** Post-COVID NSE market structure (increased retail participation, news-driven gap continuation) suits this strategy. Morning gaps in 2022–2023 have been sustaining direction more reliably than pre-2020.  
**Rule for 2024:** GAP-CONT (weight 1.27, OK verdict) deserves MEDIUM conviction tier treatment. When it fires alongside VOL-SPIKE or BULL-FLAG, the trade has two independently strong signals — this is among the best setups in the system.

**STATEMENT G — 1 trade per day produced clean, traceable results with no overexposure**  
245 trades across ~245 trading days = 1.0 trade/day average. Rs 4.15L total P&L = Rs 1,694 average per trade. The system never compounded losses through multiple same-day positions in a bad session.  
**Conclusion:** The 1-trade-per-day constraint (Phase 2 rule) is validated. It forces the system to take only the highest-composite-score opportunity each day, and 2023 results confirm this produces a cleaner equity curve with predictable per-trade performance. Maintain this constraint for all testing years.

### 2023 Paper Trades — 10 Data-Driven Findings

**FINDING 1 — The 9:00–9:30 AM window is where the system earns its living**  
162 of 245 trades (66%) fired in the 9:00 slot. Win rate: 69.1%. Avg PnL: Rs 2,484. Every slot after 9:30 drops below 53% win rate and most are negative avg PnL. The 13:30 slot is a small exception (7 trades, 85.7% win) but too few to rely on.  
**Rule for 2024:** Treat the opening 30 minutes as primary. Signals after 10:00 require composite score ≥ 5 and 4+ agreements — not just the minimums.

**FINDING 2 — VPOC is the most reliable driver strategy: it hits targets, not just direction**  
VPOC drove 71 trades at 74.6% win rate and 70.4% EXACT win rate (target price literally hit) — highest exact-win rate of any strategy. Total PnL: Rs 1,98,776.  
The learning-phase weights assigned VPOC a score of 0.50 (reduced), but actual 2023 paper trade performance ranks it as a top-tier driver.  
**Rule for 2024:** When VPOC is the driver, the target is not too ambitious — it gets reached 70% of the time. Do not second-guess the target. Hold the position.

**FINDING 3 — CAMARILLA is an equally strong but misunderstood driver**  
CAMARILLA drove 71 trades at 71.8% win rate and Rs 2,03,525 PnL. The 25.4% stop-hit rate is manageable. 18 TIME_EXIT trades were profitable (correct direction, target just missed). Its learning-phase weight of 0.50 understates actual performance.  
**Key distinction:** CAMARILLA works as the primary driver, but 46.5% exact win vs VPOC's 70.4% means CAMARILLA targets are slightly over-extended. Consider 10–15% target reduction when CAMARILLA is the sole driver with no VPOC agreement.

**FINDING 4 — ASC-TRI is directionally correct but needs target reduction**  
18 trades, 72.2% win rate, Rs 2,959 avg PnL. But 0% exact win and 100% TIME_EXIT — every single exit was time-based, no target ever hit. The strategy identifies direction accurately but sets targets beyond 2023 intraday move capacity.  
**Rule for 2024:** When ASC-TRI is the driver, manually cap the target at 1.5× the measured move instead of the full 2× or higher. This will convert TIME_EXIT wins into EXACT_WIN hits without adding risk.

**FINDING 5 — VOL-SPIKE is directionally correct but the fixed RR=2.0 is bleeding money**  
19 trades, 57.9% win rate (correct direction), but net PnL is Rs −5,418. RR was always 2.0 and the target was never hit (0% exact win). 17 of 19 exits were TIME_EXIT — stock moved the right way but didn't reach 2× the stop distance. 2 stop hits wiped out all TIME_EXIT gains.  
**Finding:** VOL-SPIKE in 2023 validated direction but overestimated target distance. The HIGH conviction tier (2× risk) amplifies this loss when the target is never reached.  
**Rule for 2024:** Use VOL-SPIKE for agreement confirmation but not as the sole driver setting the target. When it is the driver, reduce target to 1× (breakeven-to-target ratio, not 2× RR).

**FINDING 6 — Agreement count is a monotonically improving signal — 5+ is the threshold**  
| Agreeing count | Trades | Win rate | Avg PnL |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 44 | 61.4% | Rs 1,539 |
| 3 | 63 | 49.2% | Rs 39 |
| 4 | 65 | 66.2% | Rs 2,358 |
| 5 | 60 | 76.7% | Rs 2,646 |
| 6+ | 13 | 84.6% | Rs 2,520 |

3-agreement trades (63 total) are near-random at 49.2% win. 5+ agreements produce 76.7% win rate.  
**Rule for 2024:** Minimum 2 agreements is the legal floor, but optimum is 5+. Add a "HIGH_AGREEMENT" flag when 5+ strategies agree — these are near-certain setups.

**FINDING 7 — Composite score ≥ 5 is the correct trading filter — use it as a hard threshold**  
103 trades (42% of all) had composite score ≥ 5. Win rate: 75.7%. Exact win rate: 49.5%. Avg PnL: Rs 2,722.  
Score 3–4: 52 trades, 61.5% win, Rs 1,790 avg. Score 2–3: 25 trades, 48% win, Rs 349 avg.  
**Rule for 2024:** Never enter a trade with composite score < 3. Strongly prefer score ≥ 5. If the day's best signal has score < 3, skip the day entirely. Missing a day is better than forcing a marginal trade.

**FINDING 8 — High RR (> 3) setups dominate performance; low RR (≤ 2) setups lose money**  
| RR bucket | Trades | Win rate | Exact rate | Avg PnL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ≤ 2 | 88 | 48.9% | 8.0% | Rs −460 |
| 2–3 | 10 | 70.0% | 30.0% | Rs 1,820 |
| > 3 | 147 | 73.5% | 55.1% | Rs 2,943 |

88 trades with RR ≤ 2 (ORB-30, VOL-SPIKE, SR-BREAK dominated) produced negative avg PnL. 147 trades with RR > 3 (CAMARILLA, VPOC dominated) produced Rs 2,943 avg PnL.  
**Rule for 2024:** MIN_RISK_REWARD in settings is 1.5. This is too low. Raise to 2.5 or filter out trades with RR < 3 when the composite score is below 5. The market rewards patience for high-reward setups.

**FINDING 9 — Predicted win pct 50–55% is a danger zone; avoid it**  
| Predicted win % | Trades | Actual win rate | Avg PnL |
|---|---|---|---|
| 40–50% | 140 | 57.1% | Rs 1,203 |
| 50–55% | 21 | 28.6% | Rs −1,664 |
| 55–60% | 84 | 84.5% | Rs 3,220 |
| > 60% | 3 | 66.7% | Rs 2,247 |

The 50–55% predicted win pct band is anomalously bad — 28.6% actual win, worse than the 40–50% band. This is a model calibration artifact: strategies with 50–55% lifetime win rates generated marginal signals that don't have enough edge.  
**Rule for 2024:** When predicted_win_pct is 50–55%, downgrade the signal regardless of composite score. Only trade if agreement count is 5+ and score ≥ 5.

**FINDING 10 — ORB-30 as primary driver destroys value; it should only vote, not lead**  
ORB-30 drove 45 trades (18% of all). Net PnL: Rs −7,259. Avg PnL: Rs −161. Stop-hit rate: 22.2%. Exact win rate: 8.9% (only 4 targets hit out of 45 trades). 31 of 45 exits were TIME_EXIT — stock moved right but not 2× the opening range.  
**Root cause:** When ORB-30 drives, it sets a 2× measured-move target that routinely exceeds intraday move capacity. 19 of those were actually profitable TIME_EXIT (WIN) but the 10 stop hits wiped the gain.  
**Rule for 2024:** ORB-30 should never be allowed to drive the target calculation. When ORB-30 fires as agreement-vote alongside VPOC/CAMARILLA, the trade is valid. When ORB-30 is the sole driver, it requires the target to be capped at 1.5× (not 2×) and the composite score must be ≥ 5.

### 2024 Paper Trades — 10 Data-Driven Findings
*(All numbers use corrected result labels — WIN = TIME_EXIT with positive net PnL after costs)*

**FINDING 1 — System remains profitable but the edge has halved: 59.2% → 50.4% effective win rate**
Win rate fell 8.8pp (59.2% → 50.4%). Exact wins dropped from 36.3% to 28.2%. Stop hits surged from 21.6% to 32.3%. Losses: 40.8% → 49.6%. The 2024 win rate of 50.4% is just above random chance. Total PnL still increased (Rs 4.15L → Rs 5.70L) and avg PnL per trade rose Rs 1,692 → Rs 2,300 — entirely because position size doubled (3.3L → 5L).
**Warning:** Higher PnL is a size effect, not a signal of better performance. If this trajectory continues into 2025, the system's structural edge will be gone. This is the most important single number to monitor.

**FINDING 2 — VOL-SPIKE + HIGH conviction tier destroyed Rs 41,036 in 2024 — disable permanently**
15 trades driven by VOL-SPIKE. Results: 26.7% win, 0% exact win, Rs −41,036 total, Rs −2,736 avg loss. The HIGH conviction tier (2× risk = Rs 20k per trade) amplified losses on the worst-performing driver.
Two-year picture: VOL-SPIKE as driver: 2023 Rs −5,418 (52.6% win), 2024 Rs −41,036 (26.7% win). Both years 0% exact win.
**Structural flaw exposed:** The HIGH conviction tier uses 2016-2022 lifetime win rate (73.8% for VOL-SPIKE). But that win rate was earned as a voter, not as a target-setter. VOL-SPIKE identifies momentum correctly but its RR=2 target is never reached.
**Rule for 2025:** HIGH conviction tier DISABLED for VOL-SPIKE. Change engine logic to cap VOL-SPIKE at STANDARD (1× risk) regardless of lifetime win rate. Only VPOC should qualify for elevated conviction.

**FINDING 3 — CAMARILLA has fallen below 50% win rate: 69.0% → 47.4% — a critical threshold crossed**
2023: 71 trades, 69.0% win, 46.5% exact, Rs 2,03,525 PnL.
2024: 78 trades, 47.4% win, 34.6% exact, 34 stop hits (43.6% stop rate), Rs 2,10,746 PnL.
47.4% effective win rate means CAMARILLA is now below random — it's a net negative driver on win rate alone. PnL is positive only because the few exact wins are large (5L position × 34.6% exact win = significant payout per hit).
**Rule for 2025:** CAMARILLA entries require composite score ≥ 5 AND 4+ agreeing strategies. At score 3-4 skip entirely. Monitor whether 2025 continues the decline — if win rate falls below 45%, move CAMARILLA to the voter-only list.

**FINDING 4 — VPOC is declining but remains the only reliably profitable driver**
2023: 71 trades, 73.2% win, 70.4% exact, Rs 2,800 avg.
2024: 79 trades, 53.2% win, 45.6% exact, 33 stop hits (41.8% stop rate), Rs 3,689 avg.
Win rate down 20pp, exact rate down 24.8pp, stop hit rate nearly doubled. Yet still Rs 2,91,421 total PnL — the best of any driver by far. The 45.6% exact win rate means targets are still being reached nearly half the time.
**Rule for 2025:** VPOC remains the primary driver to back. When VPOC fires with score ≥ 5 and 5+ agreements, it is still the best setup available. But the stop hit surge (17 → 33) demands tighter entry conditions — only enter VPOC signals at the first touch of the VPOC level, not on extended moves away from it.

**FINDING 5 — ORB-30 flipped to 62.5% win but 2.5% exact — a direction winner, a target destroyer**
2023: 42.2% win, 8.9% exact, Rs −7,259 (net loss).
2024: 62.5% win, 2.5% exact (1 target hit in 40 trades), Rs 51,701 PnL.
The win rate flip is real but misleading — 25 wins are all TIME_EXIT profitable, the 2× measured-move target was hit exactly once. In 2024's trending market (Nifty ATH in H1), breakouts ran in the right direction but never reached the 2× extension.
**Two-year verdict:** ORB-30 has now confirmed in both years that as a driver it sets an unachievable target. It is a good directional voter but should never drive the target calculation.
**Rule for 2025:** ORB-30 removed from the driver-eligible list. When it fires as an agreement vote alongside VPOC or CAMARILLA, the trade is valid. When it is the only strong signal, pass.

**FINDING 6 — Composite score ≥ 5 is the single most reliable filter — confirmed two years running**
| Score bucket | Trades 2023 | Win% 2023 | Trades 2024 | Win% 2024 | Avg PnL 2024 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3–4 | 52 | 61.5% | 60 | 38.3% | Rs 225 |
| 4–5 | 62 | 58.1% | 61 | 41.0% | Rs 793 |
| >5 | 103 | 75.7% | 101 | 66.3% | Rs 5,138 |

Score >5 in 2024: 101 trades, 66.3% win, Rs 5,138 avg. Below score 5: 147 trades, 39.5% win, Rs 479 avg. The gap is stark and widening.
**Rule for 2025:** Score ≥ 5 is a hard gate. Skip the day if nothing scores ≥ 5. At score 3–4 in 2024 the win rate was 38.3% — worse than random. Taking those trades is actively harmful.

**FINDING 7 — 9:30 AM slot doubled in trade count (60 trades) and performs near random (41.7% win)**
9:00 AM: 115 trades, 60.9% win, 46.1% exact, Rs 4,677 avg (confirmed dominant window both years).
9:30 AM: 60 trades, 41.7% win, Rs 906 avg — barely above breakeven.
After 10:00 AM: all slots below 50% win rate. The 10:30 slot (11 trades) was 18.2% win.
The system is generating 60 qualifying signals in the 9:30 window that lack the opening momentum needed to succeed. These should be filtered more aggressively.
**Rule for 2025:** After 9:29 AM, require score ≥ 6 and 5+ agreeing strategies. After 10:30 AM, skip the day entirely unless score is outstanding (≥ 7).

**FINDING 8 — Predicted win pct 50–55% is a two-year confirmed danger zone — now 14.3% actual win**
| Year | Trades in 50–55% band | Actual win rate | Avg PnL |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 | 21 | 28.6% | Rs −1,664 |
| 2024 | 14 | 14.3% | Rs −2,655 |
The pattern is worsening each year. The 55–60% band remains the strongest signal: 84.5% win (2023), 73.0% win (2024).
**Rule for 2025:** Predicted win pct in the 50–55% range = automatic skip, regardless of score or agreement count. The model is in an uncertain zone that historically produces results worse than random.

**FINDING 9 — Stop hit rate at 32.3% signals the market regime has permanently shifted**
Stop hits: 2023 = 53 (21.6%), 2024 = 80 (32.3%). Avg loss per stop: 2023 = Rs −2,877, 2024 = Rs −3,978.
CAMARILLA drove 34 stop hits (43.6% of its trades). VPOC drove 33 (41.8% of its trades). Both top strategies are being stopped more than 40% of the time in 2024.
The 1% stop distance used by the system is too tight for 2024's intraday volatility. When stocks move 1% against the position within the same day before finding direction, entries are being placed too aggressively.
**Rule for 2025:** Widen default stops from 1% to 1.25-1.5% for VPOC and CAMARILLA signals. This will reduce quantity of positions but should significantly cut the stop-hit rate. Retest the stop-hit rate monthly; target < 25%.

**FINDING 10 — REL-STR as driver: 0% win across 5 trades totalling Rs −38,307 — permanently excluded**
2023: 1 trade, Rs −5,495. 2024: 4 trades, 0% win, Rs −32,812, avg loss Rs −8,203.
5 cumulative trades, zero profitable exits, Rs −38,307 total loss. REL-STR's signals trigger entries based on relative strength ranking which does not translate well into price target accuracy.
**Action for 2025:** REL-STR added to the driver-exclusion list (alongside EMA-CROSS, SUPERTREND, ORB-30). It continues as a voting strategy. Remove from driver-eligible logic in engine.py before the 2025 run.

### 2025 Paper Trades — 10 Data-Driven Findings

**FINDING 1 — Partial recovery in win rate but PnL fell — quality improved, revenue per trade did not**
Win rate: 50.4% → 52.8% (up 2.4pp). Stop hits: 32.3% → 29.8% (improving). But total PnL dropped from Rs 5.70L to Rs 4.48L and avg PnL per trade fell from Rs 2,300 to Rs 1,809 despite the same Rs 5L position size.
Three-year arc: 2023 (59.2%) → 2024 (50.4%) → 2025 (52.8%). The system found a floor in 2024 and is recovering, but is not back to 2023 levels. The revenue drop with improving win rate means the wins are smaller and the losses larger in absolute terms.
**Rule for 2026:** The win rate recovery is encouraging but not sufficient. Target: return to ≥55% effective win rate. If not achieved by mid-2026, initiate a structural review of entry triggers.

**FINDING 2 — VPOC recovered strongly: 53.2% → 63.7% win, 45.6% → 53.8% exact win**
2023: 71 trades, 73.2% win, 70.4% exact. 2024: 79 trades, 53.2% win (trough), 45.6% exact. 2025: 80 trades, 63.7% win, 53.8% exact, Rs 2,94,525 PnL.
VPOC bounced back in both win rate (+10.5pp) and exact win (+8.2pp). Stop hit rate improved from 41.8% to 33.8%. 2024 was a difficult year, not a structural break. VPOC remains the backbone of the system.
**Rule for 2026:** VPOC is confirmed as the system's premier driver across 3 years. Prioritise VPOC signals over all others when composite score ≥ 5. If VPOC fires with 5+ agreements at 9:00 AM, that is the highest-confidence setup available.

**FINDING 3 — CAMARILLA recovered above 50% but exact win rate keeps falling (46.5% → 34.6% → 32.8%)**
Win rate: 47.4% → 59.0% (big recovery). But exact win: 46.5% (2023) → 34.6% (2024) → 32.8% (2025) — three consecutive years of decline, now half of VPOC's 53.8%. Stop hit rate 36.1% (high but stable).
**Structural divergence:** CAMARILLA is winning directionally (price moves right) but missing targets increasingly. The H3/H4/L3/L4 levels generate correct direction but the measured-move target calculation is over-reaching. The market respects Camarilla pivot breakouts but the follow-through to the 2× extension is increasingly rare.
**Rule for 2026:** CAMARILLA target should be capped at 1.5× the H3→H4 range (not 2×). This would convert many near-misses into EXACT_WIN. Until this is implemented, accept that CAMARILLA will mostly produce WIN (TIME_EXIT profit) not EXACT_WIN.

**FINDING 4 — ORB-30 as driver is confirmed multi-year value destroyer: Rs −22,855 in 2025 (3rd straight net-negative year)**
2023: Rs −7,259 (42.2% win). 2024: Rs +51,701 (62.5% win — one lucky trending year). 2025: Rs −22,855 (36.2% win, back to loss). Three-year net as driver: −28,413.
The 2024 positive result was an anomaly driven by a trending market where ORB-30 caught direction but never hit targets. In a ranging or volatile market (2023, 2025), ORB-30 stops out frequently. 2025 also shows 4 exact wins (8.5%) — targets ARE occasionally reachable, but too rarely to be net positive.
**Verdict (final):** ORB-30 driver block is validated. The engine code fix (CONVICTION_BLOCKED) prevents it from driving but it should formally be removed from the driver-eligible list in the codebase.

**FINDING 5 — 2-agreement trades now produce only 32.3% win rate — minimum must be raised to 4**
Three-year 2-agreement win rate: 61.4% (2023) → 43.5% (2024) → 32.3% (2025). The decline is steep and consistent — 2-agreement signals in 2025 are worse than random.
Meanwhile, 5+ agreements: 76.7% (2023) → 60.5% (2024) → 75.6% (2025). 6+ agreements: 87.5% in 2025 (16 trades, Rs 6,244 avg PnL).
The MIN_STRATEGIES_AGREEING setting of 2 was calibrated in 2016-2022 when fewer strategies fired. With 22+ strategies now firing daily, 2-agreement represents a very weak signal. At least 4 strategies must agree for a trade to qualify.
**Rule for 2026:** Raise MIN_STRATEGIES_AGREEING from 2 to 4 in settings.py. This will reduce trade count but should significantly improve quality. Estimate: ~62 fewer trades per year (the 2-agreement bucket), improving system win rate to ~60%+.

**FINDING 6 — RR ≤ 2 trades are the single biggest drag: 34.3% win, Rs −1,020 avg loss in 2025**
RR breakdown in 2025:
- RR ≤ 2: 99 trades (40% of all), 34.3% win, Rs −1,020 avg — net negative
- RR 2-3: 9 trades, 77.8% win, Rs 2,504 avg
- RR 3-5: 78 trades, 69.2% win, Rs 3,806 avg
- RR > 5: 61 trades, 59.0% win, Rs 3,786 avg

99 trades with RR ≤ 2 produced average losses. These are dominated by ORB-30, ORB-15, and SR-BREAK as drivers. Even if those drivers are blocked, low-RR setups driven by other strategies should be avoided.
**Rule for 2026:** Raise MIN_RISK_REWARD from 1.5 to 2.5 in settings.py. Accept that the system should only trade setups where the potential reward is at least 2.5× the stop. This eliminates the majority of net-negative trades.

**FINDING 7 — July is confirmed as a new danger month (26.1% win); March is the perennial weak spot**
Monthly pattern across 3 years:
- March: 2023 (61.9%), 2024 (31.6%), 2025 (38.9%) — two consecutive weak years, Rs −6,174 in 2025
- July: 2024 (50%), 2025 (26.1%, Rs +3,613 barely positive) — emerging as the weakest summer month
- June: 2023 (57%), 2024 (63.2%), 2025 (71.4%, Rs 83,102) — consistently the strongest month
- September: 2023 (70%), 2024 (61.9%), 2025 (63.6%) — consistently strong

**Rule for 2026:** In March and July, use STANDARD sizing only. In June and September, the system has proven edge — maintain full sizing. Calendar awareness should directly influence position size decisions.

**FINDING 8 — SR-BREAK and ORB-15 as drivers are now confirmed for exclusion**
SR-BREAK 2025: 11 trades, 27.3% win, Rs −28,875 total, Rs −2,625 avg per trade.
ORB-15 2025: 8 trades, 25% win, Rs −19,320 total, Rs −2,415 avg per trade.
Two-year combined (2024+2025): SR-BREAK Rs −28,745, ORB-15 Rs −9,337 (2024 was better but still weak).
Neither strategy has demonstrated ability to set a target that gets reached. They identify breakout direction sometimes correctly but the measured-move target calculation overshoots systematically.
**Action for 2026:** Add SR-BREAK and ORB-15 to the CONVICTION_BLOCKED list in engine.py. They may continue to vote but must not drive the target calculation or receive elevated sizing.

**FINDING 9 — 55-60% predicted win pct band is the most reliable signal in the system: 3-year consistency**
| Year | 55-60% band actual win rate |
|---|---|
| 2023 | 84.5% |
| 2024 | 73.0% |
| 2025 | 82.9% |
Three consecutive years above 73%. This is the single most reliable filter in the entire system. When predicted_win_pct lands in the 55-60% range, the trade has an 80%+ historical success rate across 3 years.
**Rule for 2026:** When predicted_win_pct is 55-60%, treat as a GREEN ZONE signal — back it with full position size and do not second-guess the setup. This is the system's highest-confidence indicator.

**FINDING 10 — 9:30 AM slot is a confirmed 3-year trap: 46.9% → 41.7% → 36.4% win rate, declining each year**
| Year | 9:30 AM trades | Win rate | Avg PnL |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 | 32 | 46.9% | Rs −16 |
| 2024 | 60 | 41.7% | Rs 906 |
| 2025 | 44 | 36.4% | Rs −325 |
Three consecutive years of declining win rate in the 9:30 slot. Volume is also inconsistent (doubling in 2024, shrinking in 2025). The 9:00 AM slot remains dominant: 65% win, Rs 3,648 avg in 2025.
**Rule for 2026:** Hard gate at 9:29 AM. Any signal arriving at 9:30 or later must have composite score ≥ 6 AND 5+ agreeing strategies. This rule must be enforced in code, not just as a manual guideline. Add it to the pre-filter logic in engine.py.

### 2026 Paper Trades — 10 Data-Driven Findings
*(104 trades, Jan 2026 – Jun 2026, Rs 5L capital)*

---

**FINDING 1 — System win rate recovered to 57.7% (best since 2023), avg PnL/trade Rs 2,958 (highest across all testing years)**

Three-year testing trend: 59.2% → 50.4% → 52.8% → 57.7% win rate; Rs 1,692 → Rs 2,300 → Rs 1,809 → Rs 2,958 avg PnL.
This is the first year all three metrics (WR, avg PnL, total PnL rate) improved simultaneously.
Total PnL of Rs 3,07,661 in just 104 trades (half-year) = Rs 2,958/trade, strongest cadence in system history.
**Action for H2 2026:** No structural changes warranted on win-rate grounds — maintain current settings and observe whether trajectory holds.

---

**FINDING 2 — CAMARILLA had its best year ever: 80.0% WR, Rs 1,96,324 from just 25 trades**

Four-year CAMARILLA WR: 69.0% → 47.4% → 59.0% → **80.0%**. Exact-win rate also recovered strongly: 46.5% → 34.6% → 32.8% → **52.0%**.
25 trades (24% of volume) generated Rs 1,96,324 — 64% of total 2026 PnL. No other strategy comes close per trade.
The MIN_STRATEGIES_AGREEING=4 filter appears to have elevated setup quality — only high-agreement CAMARILLA signals got through.
**Action:** Treat CAMARILLA as co-equal with VPOC for driver priority. Confirm MIN_STRATEGIES_AGREEING=4 is live in engine before H2 run.

---

**FINDING 3 — VPOC is on a two-year decline: 73.2% → 53.2% → 63.7% → 50.0% WR; exact wins dropped to 40.0% (lowest ever)**

30 trades, 50.0% WR, Rs 92,704 net positive — but all wins were TIME_EXIT, none reached the set target.
VPOC signals in 2026 are generating directional movement but falling short of full RR targets — potentially a tightening market.
2023-2025 average: 63.4% WR. Dropping to 50.0% in H1 2026 is a structural warning.
**Action:** Raise composite score floor for VPOC-driven trades to ≥6 in H2 2026. Monitor — if Q3 2026 WR stays ≤52%, review VPOC driver eligibility.

---

**FINDING 4 — 55-60% predicted win pct: 81.1% actual win rate — 4th consecutive year above 72%, averaging 79.5%**

Four-year actual win rates when pwp is 55-60%: 81.7% → 72.6% → 82.6% → **81.1%** (2023-2026).
37 trades landed in this band in 2026 — 30 won. No other signal in the system is this consistent across 4 years.
Bands below 55% and above 60% both underperformed (45.6% and 0.0% respectively in 2026).
**Action:** When predicted_win_pct is 55-60% AND composite_score ≥ 5 AND agreeing ≥ 4 → treat as MEDIUM conviction floor regardless of driver strategy.

**FINDING 5 — Trades with ≥4 agreeing strategies: 66.7% WR, Rs 2,47,616 (80% of total PnL) vs 46.8% WR, Rs 60,044 below threshold**

57 trades (≥4 agreeing): 66.7% WR, Rs 2,47,616. 47 trades (<4 agreeing): 46.8% WR, Rs 60,044.
The 47 under-threshold trades were allowed through — MIN_STRATEGIES_AGREEING=4 was not yet live during the 2026 run.
Agreement ≥5: 26 trades at 73.1% WR. Agreement ≥6: 7 trades at 85.7% WR. Monotonically improving with each additional agreement.
**Action:** Confirm MIN_STRATEGIES_AGREEING=4 is applied in engine.py before H2 2026. This single change would have excluded 47 trades and filtered out the bulk of losing capital.

---

**FINDING 6 — VOL-SPIKE: 4th consecutive year negative as driver; 0 exact wins in 9 trades, Rs -13,218**

9 trades, 44.4% WR — all 4 wins were partial TIME_EXIT, none hit the stated target.
CONVICTION_BLOCKED correctly caps it at STANDARD sizing, but the strategy is still being selected as driver.
Four-year pattern as driver: consistently below 50% WR, never reaches price targets.
**Action:** Remove VOL-SPIKE from driver-eligible list entirely. It can vote (raise agreeing_count and composite_score) but should never set the target/stop. Add to a `DRIVER_BLOCKED` set separate from CONVICTION_BLOCKED.

---

**FINDING 7 — February and May are confirmed dual weak months: 38.1% and 36.8% WR in 2026**

February: 21 trades, 38.1% WR — ORB-30 drove 5 trades at negative PnL, VPOC drove 7 at 42.9%.
May: 19 trades, 36.8% WR — ASC-TRI drove 6 trades at 16.7% WR, ORB-30 drove 2 at 0%.
March 73.7%, April 70.0%, June 80.0% (5 trades early data). Strong alternating pattern visible.
**Action for H2 2026:** Apply STANDARD sizing cap in February and May. Skip signals with composite_score <6 in these months.

---

**FINDING 8 — Composite score ≥6 = 81.5% WR (27 trades, Rs 1,73,531); score <4 = near-zero win rate**

Score ≥4: 80 trades, 63.7% WR. Score ≥5: 50 trades, 70.0% WR. Score ≥6: 27 trades, 81.5% WR.
Trades below score 4 (15 trades): nearly all losses, most contributed negative PnL.
The gap between score <4 and score ≥6 is 81.5 percentage points — the clearest quality discriminator in the system.
**Action:** Implement hard floor of composite_score ≥5 in engine.py. For signals after 9:29 AM, raise floor to ≥6 (consistent with 2025 FINDING 10).

---

**FINDING 9 — RR >3.0 trades drove 91% of total PnL: Rs 2,81,051 from 57 trades at 63.2% WR; RR 2.0-3.0 was break-even**

RR >3.0: 57 trades, 63.2% WR, Rs 2,81,051 (91% of total PnL).
RR 2.0-3.0: 46 trades, 50.0% WR, Rs 7,907 — essentially zero net return on deployed capital and risk.
MIN_RISK_REWARD is currently 1.5. Raising to 2.5 (2025 FINDING 6 recommendation) would eliminate the entire break-even RR 2-2.5 bucket.
**Action:** Implement MIN_RISK_REWARD=2.5 before H2 2026 run. RR below 3.0 contributes almost nothing to annual PnL and dilutes win rate metrics.

---

**FINDING 10 — ASC-TRI has 0 exact wins in 3 years of paper trading as driver (45 trades, 2024-2026); never reaches price targets**

2024: 17 trades, 41.2% WR, 0 exact wins. 2025: 16 trades, 62.5% WR, 0 exact wins. 2026: 12 trades, 41.7% WR, 0 exact wins.
Every ASC-TRI win over 3 years has been a TIME_EXIT partial — the strategy correctly identifies direction but breakout targets are consistently over-estimated.
Structurally identical to VOL-SPIKE: fires correctly but the RR setup as a driver is fundamentally flawed.
**Action:** Add ASC-TRI to CONVICTION_BLOCKED immediately. Consider full driver removal in next annual review if 0 exact wins persists into Q3 2026.

## Year 2016 Summary
- Total trades        : 244 (7 LONG, 237 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 161 (66.0%)  — price reached target
- Profitable exits    : 32 (13.1%)  — TIME_EXIT with positive P&L

### Phase 2B WF-1 2016 — 10 Key Insights

*First year of bidirectional training. 37 strategies (27 legacy + 10 new short-side). Independent wt_long / wt_short per strategy. 1 trade/day — best direction wins.*

---

**INSIGHT 1 — 79.1% win rate is the highest first-year learning result in system history**

Phase 2A 2016: 693 trades at 30.2% win rate. Phase 2B 2016: 244 trades at 79.1% win rate. The dramatic improvement comes from two structural changes: (1) 1 trade/day forces selection of only the best composite signal, (2) Phase 2B takes both LONG and SHORT, always choosing the stronger direction. The "best direction wins" architecture eliminates marginal trades.
**Implication for WF-1:** The 79.1% baseline is elite. Expect it to moderate in 2017-2018 as diverse market conditions dilute the exceptional 2016 short-side edge. A drop to 65-70% across the 3-year WF-1 window would still be excellent.

---

**INSIGHT 2 — Short side dominated 97% of all trades (237 SHORT / 7 LONG)**

The short composite score consistently exceeded the long composite score in 2016. Two factors: (1) Demonetization (Nov 8 → Dec 30) created a sustained 7-week bearish environment where short strategies fired with very high composite scores, (2) The bidirectional pre-filter (100 bull + 100 bear) ensured short candidates were always represented. Without short-side access, the system would have had almost no signals in Q4 2016.
**Key moment:** Nov 25 pre-filter: 12 bull / 67 bear. Nov 16: 12 bull / 62 bear. The system correctly loaded on short candidates during the worst of the crash, earning 92% of total P&L from shorts (Rs 715,232 short / Rs 73,954 long).

---

**INSIGHT 3 — RSI-EXT and VWAP-REV are LONG-ONLY: short weights suppressed to 0.25 and 0.12**

RSI-EXT: wt_long=3.00 (maxed) / wt_short=0.25 (suppressed). VWAP-REV: wt_long=3.00 (maxed) / wt_short=0.12 (lowest short weight in system).
These mean-reversion strategies identify oversold bounces (buy) with high accuracy. The reverse — overbought stocks reverting downward — does not hold. In trending markets, stocks overshoot VWAP upward and keep going. The market's structural long bias means upside momentum persists; downside reversion from overbought is unreliable.
**Rule for WF-1 and beyond:** Never use RSI-EXT or VWAP-REV as drivers for short trades. Their short weights should remain suppressed across all WF windows.

---

**INSIGHT 4 — PDH-PDL is SHORT-ONLY: wt_long=0.28, wt_short=3.00 — the clearest directional asymmetry**

Previous Day Low breakdown (short entry) was far more reliable than Previous Day High breakout (long entry) in 2016. PDH-PDL short win rate: 83.3% across 51 signals — highest in the system. Upside PDH breakouts created "bull trap" patterns; PDL breakdowns created clean continuation. In corrective phases, stocks collapse past PDL and never recover it intraday.
**Rule for WF-1:** PDH-PDL is one of the strongest SHORT drivers available. When PDL breaks with 4+ agreeing strategies, this is a top-tier short setup. As a long signal, treat PDH-PDL as a voter only, not a driver.

---

**INSIGHT 5 — SR-BREAK achieved 80.0% win rate — highest of all 37 strategies in both directions**

SR-BREAK: wt_long=3.00, wt_short=3.00, 55 signals, 80.0% win rate. Support/Resistance levels are well-defined in Indian equities. 2016's volatility created clean decisive breaks through established S/R levels in both directions. The strategy's dual-direction capability makes it the most versatile in the system.
**Rule:** SR-BREAK remains eligible as a driver in both directions. When SR-BREAK is the driver with 4+ agreements, it is a high-quality setup regardless of market direction.

---

**INSIGHT 6 — All 10 new Phase 2B short strategies produced meaningful signals within year 1**

BEAR-ENGULF: 63.5% win, 48 sigs → wt_short=3.00. OPEN-WEAK: 63.9%, 18 sigs → 3.00. FAILED-BO: 55.0%, 50 sigs → 3.00. BEAR-FLAG: 72.2%, 9 sigs → 3.00. INTRADAY-STRUCT (short): 79.2%, 53 sigs → 3.00. DAILY-BIAS (short): 69.2%, 52 sigs → 3.00. DBL-TOP: 60.0%, 30 sigs → 1.90.
The new strategies validated themselves in a single year — but small samples for some (RISE-WEDGE: 1 signal at 100%, BEAR-FLAG: 9 signals) mean their maxed weights are not yet trustworthy.
**Rule:** Treat short strategies with fewer than 20 signals in 2016 as provisionally weighted. Their weights will be re-earned in 2017 when samples grow.

---

**INSIGHT 7 — VOL-SPIKE produced 0 short signals in all of 2016 despite a major crash**

VOL-SPIKE fired 0 short trades even through the demonetization collapse. The strategy requires unusual volume at a resistance level — but during the crash, volume surged everywhere as stocks collapsed indiscriminately without clean resistance levels forming. Mass liquidation does not create the structured volume-at-resistance pattern that VOL-SPIKE needs. wt_short=1.00 (default, unchanged — no data to update).
**Implication:** VOL-SPIKE's short side is completely untested after year 1. Do not allow it to drive short trades until at least 10 short signals accumulate across 2017-2018.

---

**INSIGHT 8 — 66% exact target hit rate sets the benchmark for a healthy Phase 2B system**

161 of 244 trades hit the exact price target (TARGET_HIT). Only 51 stops hit (20.9% stop rate). This 66% exact win rate is the highest ever seen in this system. When only the day's single best composite signal is taken, targets get reached 2/3 of the time. If this rate drops below 40% in any WF testing window, the system has changed character and requires investigation.

---

**INSIGHT 9 — Demonetization (Nov 8) was the first major regime-change stress test — the system passed**

The pre-filter shifted from 56 bull/8 bear to 12 bull/67 bear within 15 trading days. The system switched to short-only mode naturally — short composite score overwhelmed long without manual intervention. Both the pre-filter (detecting regime change from price history alone) and the composite scorer (elevating bear strategies automatically) worked exactly as designed. No override required.
**System validation:** The bidirectional architecture is regime-aware. Future crashes or sustained bear phases will be handled identically. This is the core advantage of Phase 2B over Phase 2A.

---

**INSIGHT 10 — WF-1 checkpoint: weight state entering 2017**

Long weights maxed (3.00): ORB-15, ORB-30, BOLLINGER, SUPERTREND, MACD, SR-BREAK, FIRST-CANDLE, CAMARILLA, REL-STR, PIN-BAR, VWAP-REV, RSI-EXT (12 strategies).
Short weights maxed (3.00): ORB-15, ORB-30, PDH-PDL, SR-BREAK, BOLLINGER, SUPERTREND, MACD, FIRST-CANDLE, CAMARILLA, REL-STR, PIN-BAR, STOCHASTIC, VPOC, INTRADAY-STRUCT, RISE-WEDGE, BEAR-FLAG, FAILED-BO, OPEN-WEAK, BEAR-ENGULF, DAILY-BIAS, ADX-FILTER, CPR (22 strategies).
Long-suppressed (< 0.50): PDH-PDL (0.28), CPR (0.25), VWAP-STDDEV (0.25), ADX-FILTER (0.375).
Short-suppressed (< 0.50): RSI-EXT (0.25), VWAP-REV (0.12), DESC-TRI (0.25).
**Note:** Far more short weights are maxed than long — 2016 was primarily a short-earning year. 2017 will test whether long strategies reclaim higher weights in a different market environment.

## Year 2017 Summary
- Total trades        : 247 (64 LONG, 183 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 150 (60.7%)  — price reached target
- Profitable exits    : 48 (19.4%)  — TIME_EXIT with positive P&L
- Losses              : 49 (19.8%)  — stopped out or negative exit
- Effective win rate  : 80.2%
- Total P&L           : Rs 751,821  (Long Rs 168,562 | Short Rs 583,259)

### Phase 2B WF-1 2017 — Key Insights

| # | Insight | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Short still dominated despite 2017 being a strong bull year (Nifty +28%)** | 183 SHORT vs 64 LONG. Short weights were maxed from 2016 and still winning the daily composite score competition. Individual stocks show bearish intraday patterns even in a rising index (sector rotation, profit booking). System is stock-specific, not index-specific — this is correct behaviour. |
| 2 | **Long-side split: SUPERTREND, MACD, STOCHASTIC all dropped from 3.0 → 0.38 on long, but held at 3.0 on short** | These are naturally "bearish indicator" strategies — their signals work better for identifying downside. Long signals from lagging indicators (MACD crossover, SUPERTREND flip) arrive too late in a trending bull move. Their short-side weights are untouched because they rarely fired short in 2017's bull environment. By 2018 these will either recover on long or confirm they belong on the short-side only. |
| 3 | **Stop hit rate dropped to 19.8% — lowest in system history** | Phase 2A averaged 40-43% stop rate. Phase 2B 1-trade/day quality filter cut this to 19.8% in 2017. Only 49 stops out of 247 trades. The tradeoff: lower trade count, but when you enter you're right on direction 80% of the time. This validates the 1-trade/day architecture for capital preservation. |
| PDH-PDL            | 0.18 | 3.00 |  68.9% |   95 | REDUCED |

## Year 2018 Summary
- Total trades        : 245 (1 LONG, 244 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 147 (60.0%)  — price reached target
- Profitable exits    : 42 (17.1%)  — TIME_EXIT with positive P&L
- Losses              : 56 (22.9%)  — stopped out or negative exit
- Effective win rate  : 77.1%

### Phase 2B WF-1 2018 — Key Insights

| # | Insight | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **SHORT dominance reached extreme: 244/245 trades** | Despite H1 2018 being a major bull run (Nifty hit ATH 11,760 in Aug), the system took only 1 LONG trade all year. Short weights maxed from 2016-2017 consistently beat long composite scores in the daily 1-trade competition. Pre-market pre-filter data confirms this: Jan 2018 showed 90+ bull stocks yet SHORT signals still won on individual stock scores. System is not trading the index — it's trading bearish intraday patterns on specific stocks which exist regardless of index direction. |
| 2 | **Win rate moderated to 77.1% — still elite, but confirms ceiling** | Three years in: 2016→79.1%, 2017→80.2%, 2018→77.1%. The slight decline is expected: as short weights locked in, the system took more marginal SHORT signals (scoring edge is still there but thinner). The Oct 2018 IL&FS crash (pre-market briefly showed 17 bull / 94 bear) helped reinforce the SHORT bias. The 22.9% loss rate (up from 19.8% in 2017) is the trade-off — system is taking more short trades overall, and some miss. |
| 3 | **FIRST-CANDLE and VPOC suppressed on long — short side maxed** | These two strategies were suppressed on long (0.10) but held at 3.0 on short. EMA-CROSS, SR-BREAK, REL-STR all fell from 3.0→0.38 on long despite 59-70% win rates because they had almost no long execution context to maintain their weights. The WF-1 training conclusion: 12 of 32 strategies have long weights below 0.5, confirming the system has self-organized into a SHORT-DOMINANT architecture over 3 years. |

## Year 2019 Summary
- Total trades        : 242 (0 LONG, 242 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 141 (58.3%)  — price reached target

- Effective win rate  : 77.3%
- Total P&L           : Rs 677,813  (Long Rs 0 | Short Rs 677,813)

### Phase 2B WF-1 2019 — Key Insights (TEST YEAR — frozen weights, no updates)

| # | Insight | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **WF-1 gate: PASS ✓ — Rs 6.77L positive P&L on unseen data** | 2019 is the first true out-of-sample test. Frozen weights from 2016-2018 training were applied with zero adaptation. Result: 77.3% win rate, Rs 677,813 P&L — nearly identical to training years (2016→79.1%, 2017→80.2%, 2018→77.1%). The strategy weights generalised cleanly to an unseen year. WF-1 passes the gate. |
| 2 | **0 LONG trades in a bull year (Nifty +12% in 2019) — frozen weights held the SHORT bias** | With weights locked, the system couldn't adapt to 2019's bullish environment. It took 242 SHORT trades and 0 LONG. This is the known limitation of frozen-weight testing: the edge built from 2016-2018 was SHORT-specific. The win rate held (77.3%) because individual stock bearish patterns exist regardless of index direction. When WF-2 trains through 2019, the long weights may recover. |
| 3 | **Loss rate stable at 22.7% — no degradation on unseen data** | Training years averaged 21-23% loss rate. Testing came in at 22.7% — within the same band. This confirms the 1-trade/day quality filter (score gate + agreeing filter) is not overfitted. The system is not memorising training regimes; it is selecting genuinely high-quality setups that hold up forward. |

## Phase 2B WF-2 Training — 2019

## Year 2019 Summary
- Total trades        : 244 (0 LONG, 244 SHORT)

### Phase 2B WF-2 2019 — Key Insights (TRAINING YEAR — adaptive weights)

| # | Insight | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **0 LONG trades in a bull year — 4th consecutive SHORT-only year** | 2019 was Nifty +12% yet the system took 244 SHORT and 0 LONG. Even in adaptive mode (weights free to update), the starting WF-1 weights made SHORT composite score dominate every single day. The feedback loop is self-reinforcing: SHORT wins → only SHORT outcomes recorded → long weights never updated → SHORT wins again. |
| 2 | **Win rate jumped 83.6% vs 77.3% frozen — adaptive updates added real value** | WF-1 test (frozen weights) produced 77.3% on 2019 data. The same year in adaptive training produced 83.6%. The +6.3pp gap is entirely from in-year weight tuning: the system learned to tighten SHORT selection as 2019 progressed, reducing losses from 22.7% to 16.4%. |
| 3 | **Loss rate collapsed to 16.4% — lowest across all training years** | 2016: 20.9%, 2017: 19.8%, 2018: 22.9%, 2019: 16.4%. The SHORT signals are getting cleaner each year. 16 strategies show 0 L_Sig — they generated zero LONG signals all year, confirming the market regime selection is purely SHORT-facing for those strategies. |
| 4 | **Short win rates surged across the board** | SUPERTREND: 64.5%→72.5%, MACD: 63%→71%, SR-BREAK: 70%→73.5%, STOCHASTIC: 64.5%→71.5%, REL-STR: 65.5%→72.5%. Every momentum/trend-following strategy improved its SHORT win rate after one year of 2019 adaptive updates — the signals found higher-quality setups. |
| 5 | **WF-2 freeze ready** | 2019 training complete. Next: freeze WF-2 weights and test on 2020. 2020 is the COVID crash year — the first major stress test for this SHORT-dominant system. |

## Year 2020 Summary
- Total trades        : 248 (5 LONG, 243 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 138 (55.6%)  — price reached target
- Profitable exits    : 53 (21.4%)  — TIME_EXIT with positive P&L
- Losses              : 57 (23.0%)  — stopped out or negative exit
- Effective win rate  : 77.0%
- Total P&L           : Rs 910,726  (Long Rs 26,431 | Short Rs 884,294)

### Phase 2B WF-2 2020 — Key Insights (TEST YEAR — frozen weights, no updates)

| # | Insight | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **WF-2 gate: PASS ✓ — Rs 9.10L positive P&L on unseen COVID year** | 2020 is the most extreme stress test possible — COVID crash (Feb–Mar), Nifty fell 38%, then complete V-recovery by Nov. Frozen WF-2 weights (trained 2016-2019) produced 248 trades at 77.0% win rate and Rs 910,726. Gate requires positive P&L — this is strongly positive. WF-2 window passes. |
| 2 | **243 SHORT out of 248 total — frozen SHORT bias held through the COVID crash and recovery** | WF-2 weights were SHORT-dominant from 3 years of training. During the crash phase (Feb–Mar), SHORT signals were machine-like: individual stocks breaking down, sector rotation, high volatility. Even in the recovery (Apr–Nov), individual-stock bearish setups continued. The system never needed to override to LONG — it naturally picked the 5 LONG trades where the composite score favoured them. |
| 3 | **55.6% exact target hit rate — highest exact win rate ever recorded** | Target hit 138 times out of 248 trades. In training years (WF-1): 66% exact. WF-1 test 2019: not separately tracked. WF-2 test 2020: 55.6% — below training but still the most target hits in a test year. COVID volatility created wide intraday swings that routinely reached SHORT targets. |
| 4 | **77.0% effective win rate — matches WF-1 test year (77.3%)** | Two consecutive out-of-sample test years produced near-identical win rates: WF-1 2019 = 77.3%, WF-2 2020 = 77.0%. This is not coincidence — the quality filter (score gate, 4+ agreeing, lifetime WR filter) is stable across wildly different market regimes (2019 bull, 2020 crash+recovery). The filter is regime-invariant. |
| 5 | **Per-strategy L_Sig/S_Sig breakdown unavailable** | Engine bug: `_update_perf` was gated by `not freeze_weights`, so perf tracking was skipped in WF testing mode. Bug fixed in session — future WF windows (3, 4, 5) will have full per-strategy breakdowns. Trade data exists in `data/trade_logs/2020/trades.parquet` but mixed with Phase 2A adaptive run. |

## Year 2020 Summary
- Total trades        : 251 (0 LONG, 251 SHORT)

### Phase 2B WF-3 Training — 2020 Key Insights (TRAINING YEAR — adaptive weights)

| # | Insight | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **251 trades, 0 LONG — first adaptive year with zero long trades** | The system found no LONG signal strong enough to beat the SHORT composite score on any of the 252 trading days. 2020 was a year of violent sector rotation (FMCG, Pharma, IT surged; Banks, Autos, Infra crashed) — individual-stock SHORT setups continuously outscored LONG setups even when the Nifty index was recovering. This confirms the bidirectional architecture is working as designed: it did not need manual override to switch to LONG mode. |
| 2 | **77.3% win rate — consistent with WF-2 test result (77.0%)** | Same data year, two different runs: WF-2 frozen test = 77.0%, WF-3 adaptive training = 77.3%. The ~0.3pp difference is negligible and entirely from adaptive weight updates changing which trades were taken on the margin. The quality filter produces the same win rate regardless of whether weights are frozen or live — this proves the filter, not the weights, is the primary driver of win rate. |
| 3 | **56.6% exact target hit rate — COVID volatility reached targets reliably** | 142 of 251 trades hit the exact price target. Wide intraday ranges in 2020 (VIX remained elevated even during recovery) meant SHORT targets were reached faster than normal years. This is a regime-specific tailwind — expect lower exact-win rates in calmer 2021. |
| 4 | **CAMARILLA was the dominant SHORT driver throughout 2020** | From the trade log: CIPLA, KOTAKBANK, HINDUNILVR, GLENMARK, CUMMINSIND, BAJAJ-AUTO, APOLLOHOSP, ACC, ITC, SBILIFE — all CAMARILLA-driven SHORTs. 67.5% win rate on 50 L_Sig + 50 S_Sig. CAMARILLA H3 rejections were reliable SHORT setups in 2020 because stocks gap-opened into resistance on news, then reversed intraday. wt_short stays at 3.00. |
| 5 | **BEAR-FLAG: 72.7% win on 22 SHORT signals — highest single-direction win rate** | BEAR-FLAG generated only 22 short signals but hit 72.7%. These are high-conviction chart pattern setups (bearish flag consolidation then breakdown). The low signal count is by design — the pattern is selective. wt_short=3.00 maintained. |
| 6 | **FAILED-BO downgraded: wt_short 3.00 → 1.50 after 51% win on 50 signals** | FAILED-BO was a top performer in WF-1/2 training. In 2020 recovery, failed breakout setups were being reclaimed — the V-recovery meant stocks that "failed" a breakout often reversed to break out successfully, stopping out SHORT positions. The adaptive system correctly penalised it. |
| 7 | **VWAP-REV collapsed on SHORT side: wt_short 0.10 (suppressed), 35.2% combined win** | VWAP-REV depends on price reverting after touching VWAP. In the 2020 recovery (Apr–Nov), stocks were in strong uptrends — VWAP touches became buy-the-dip opportunities, not SHORT entries. The adaptive system suppressed VWAP-REV short. This is correct regime behaviour. |
| 8 | **WF-3 freeze ready** | 2020 adaptive training complete. Weights now incorporate COVID crash + V-recovery dynamics. Next: freeze as WF-3 and test on 2021. 2021 is a strong momentum bull year (Nifty +24%) — the toughest test for a SHORT-biased system. Gate = positive P&L on 2021 with WF-3 frozen weights. |

## Year 2021 Summary
- Total trades        : 247 (1 LONG, 246 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 128 (51.8%)  — price reached target
- Profitable exits    : 61 (24.7%)  — TIME_EXIT with positive P&L
- Losses              : 58 (23.5%)  — stopped out or negative exit
- Effective win rate  : 76.5%
- Total P&L           : Rs 717,848  (Long Rs 2,794 | Short Rs 715,055)

### Phase 2B WF-3 2021 — Key Insights (TEST YEAR — frozen weights, no updates)

| # | Insight | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **WF-3 gate: PASS ✓ — Rs 7.17L in a Nifty +24% bull year** | 2021 was the toughest possible test for a SHORT-dominant system — Nifty surged 24%, the strongest bull year in the dataset. Frozen WF-3 weights (trained 2016–2020) still produced 247 trades at 76.5% win rate and Rs 717,848. The system found individual-stock SHORT setups daily even as the index rose. WF-3 passes. |
| 2 | **Three WF windows: 77.3% → 77.0% → 76.5% — the filter is regime-invariant** | WF-1 test 2019 (bull): 77.3%. WF-2 test 2020 (crash+recovery): 77.0%. WF-3 test 2021 (strong bull): 76.5%. Total degradation over 3 out-of-sample years: 0.8pp. This is the most important number in the entire WF exercise — the win rate is not eroding. The quality filter (4+ agreeing, lifetime WR gate, score gate, predicted win% danger zone) produces the same result regardless of whether Nifty is up, down, or crashing. |
| 3 | **246 SHORT, 1 LONG — SHORT dominance held even in Nifty +24%** | Frozen WF-3 weights are SHORT-biased from 5 years of training. But more importantly, the 10 SHORT-only strategies (BEAR-ENGULF, OPEN-WEAK, DBL-TOP etc.) structurally produce higher SHORT composite scores on most days. 2021 confirms this holds even in the best bull market in the dataset. The single LONG trade (Rs 2,794 profit) shows LONG signals DO fire — they just rarely beat the SHORT score. |
| 4 | **51.8% exact target hit rate — 2nd highest in WF testing** | 128 of 247 trades hit exact target. Slightly below 2020 (55.6%) as expected — in a bull year, bearish momentum takes longer to materialize and targets are occasionally missed by a small margin before recovery. Still a high exact-win rate confirming targets are appropriately sized. |
| 5 | **CAMARILLA: 65.7% win, dominant SHORT driver across every WF year** | From the trade log: ICICIGI (twice), ICICIPRULI, MUTHOOTFIN (twice), SBILIFE, ADANIGREEN, MARICO, COALINDIA, IDEA, SBILIFE, GLENMARK — all CAMARILLA-driven SHORTs. Even in a +24% bull year, stocks gap into H3 resistance at open and reverse intraday. CAMARILLA is the most reliable SHORT-side setup structure in this system. wt_short=3.00 fully justified. |
| 6 | **STOCHASTIC surged to 74.5% win on 51 signals — best surprise of WF-3** | STOCHASTIC carries a low wt_short=0.25 (suppressed) from Phase 2A legacy. But its win rate in WF-3 testing is 74.5% — higher than CAMARILLA (65.7%), ORB-30 (71.6%), and every other high-signal strategy. Overbought stochastic readings in individual stocks reliably preceded short-term pullbacks even in the bull market. This weight should rise significantly in WF-4 training. |
| 7 | **ORB-30: 71.6% win on 51 signals — strong SHORT voter, still excluded as driver** | ORB-30 generates excellent SHORT agreement votes (71.6% win) but is blocked from driving the target calculation (CONVICTION_BLOCKED). This validates the Phase 2A finding: ORB-30 identifies breakout direction correctly but its 2× target is unreachable. In WF-3 it voted correctly in 71.6% of trades it appeared in — keep as voter, never as driver. |
| 8 | **RSI-EXT: 48.0% — only strategy below 50% with 50 signals, struggles on SHORT side in bull markets** | RSI-EXT has been the most reliable mid-tier strategy in Phase 2A LONG mode (57–68% win rates). On the SHORT side in a +24% bull year, RSI oversold readings were false floors — stocks bounced quickly and SHORT targets were not reached. wt_short=3.00 is too high given this underperformance; expect adaptive training to reduce it. |
| 9 | **VWAP-STDDEV: 34.9% win — consistent underperformer on SHORT side, exclusion candidate** | 43 SHORT signals at 34.9% win rate. This is the second WF year where VWAP-STDDEV shorts underperform. In 2020 training it was suppressed (wt_short=0.50 → 0.10). In 2021 testing it confirmed 34.9%. VWAP standard deviation bands don't reliably identify SHORT entry points — the short-side signal fires too early before a genuine move materializes. |
| 10 | **WF-4 freeze ready — 3/5 windows now confirmed positive** | WF-1 PASS (Rs 6.77L), WF-2 PASS (Rs 9.10L), WF-3 PASS (Rs 7.17L). Three consecutive out-of-sample years, three passes. Next: run_analysis.py 2021 (adaptive training), freeze WF-4, test 2022. 2022 is a sustained bear year (Nifty −4%, Russia-Ukraine, FED rate hikes, high VIX) — a SHORT-dominant system's natural home environment. |

## WF-3 Walk-Forward Test: 2021 (frozen weights from 2016–2020 training)
*Tested 2026-06-22. Regime: "Strong Momentum Bull". Gate: PASS.*

- **Trades:** 247 | **Win rate:** 76.5% | **PnL:** Rs 717,848

**FINDING 1 — WF-3 gate PASSED in a strong bull year with no regime penalty**
76.5% win rate in 2021 is consistent with WF-1 (77.3% in 2019 late-bull) and WF-2 (77.0% in 2020 COVID crash). Despite 2021 being a "strong momentum bull" (Nifty +24%), performance did not inflate or collapse — the frozen filter system produced stable results. Three consecutive WF windows in the 76–78% band confirms the system is regime-agnostic.

**FINDING 2 — WF3 weights were almost exclusively SHORT in 2021's bull market**
The perf files show 1,164 short strategy outcome entries vs only 13 long entries across all 247 trades. Weights trained on 2016–2020 (including the 2020 COVID crash) pushed most strategies to short=3.0. The system found individual-stock short setups throughout a Nifty bull year — proving that even in strong uptrends, sector rotation and stock-level weakness provide intraday short opportunities.

**FINDING 3 — Top SHORT drivers in a bull year: STOCHASTIC, PDH-PDL, ORB-30, SR-BREAK, CAMARILLA**
Best performing short strategies in WF-3 test: STOCHASTIC 66% wr (50 trades), PDH-PDL 64%, ORB-30 60%, SR-BREAK 60%, CAMARILLA 58%. These mean-reversion and breakout-fade strategies worked reliably even against a bull macro backdrop — individual stocks still produced intraday exhaustion moves that reversed.

**FINDING 4 — VWAP-STDDEV and DESC-TRI are confirmed unreliable shorts across multiple WF windows**
VWAP-STDDEV: 26% wr (43 trades). DESC-TRI: 26% wr (19 trades). Both are the worst-performing shorts in WF-3. VWAP-STDDEV has been weak across all prior windows. These two strategies consistently underperform when used as short signals regardless of regime. Their votes should be discounted in the agreement count for short trades.

**FINDING 5 — VWAP-REV is also a weak short in bull markets (33% wr) despite being a strong long**
VWAP-REV hit 33% wr on shorts in WF-3 (21 trades). However its lifetime strength is on the LONG side (61.8% lifetime). WF-3 confirms that VWAP-REV short signals in momentum bull years fade against the prevailing trend. Rule: VWAP-REV agreement should be weighted more heavily for LONGs than SHORTs, particularly when Nifty trend is up.

## Year 2022 Summary
> **Note:** The terminal log showed 71 trades / Rs 121,033 because the computer shut down mid-run and the second-session summary only counted trades processed after restart. The parquet file (`data/trade_logs/2022/trades.parquet`) contains all 247 trades with no date duplicates, confirming full-year completeness. All stats below are from the parquet.

- Total trades        : 247 (0 LONG, 247 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 124 (50.2%)  — price reached target
- Profitable exits    : 57 (23.1%)   — TIME_EXIT with positive P&L
- Losses              : 66 (26.7%)   — stopped out or negative TIME_EXIT (STOP_HIT: 43, TE−: 23)
- Effective win rate  : 73.3%
- Total P&L           : Rs 618,792  (Long Rs 0 | Short Rs 618,792)

### Phase 2B WF-4 Training — 2021 Key Insights (TRAINING YEAR — adaptive weights)
Training 2021 updated `strategy_weights.json` with adaptive learning. Weights frozen as `wf4_weights.json` before testing 2022.

### Phase 2B WF-4 2022 — Key Insights (TEST YEAR — frozen weights, no updates)
Weights used: `wf4_weights.json` (trained 2016–2021). Test regime: sustained bear market, Nifty −4%, Russia-Ukraine war, FED rate hikes, high VIX throughout.

| # | Insight | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **WF-4 gate: PASS ✓ — Rs 6.19L in a sustained bear year** | 2022 was a bear/sideways year (Nifty −4%) with persistent high VIX from FED hikes and geopolitical shock. The SHORT-dominant system was in its natural environment. 247 trades, 73.3% WR, Rs 618,792 profit. WF-4 passes. Running tally: 4 out of 4 windows positive. |
| 2 | **Four consecutive WF windows: 77.3% → 77.0% → 76.5% → 73.3%** | WF-1 (2019 bull): 77.3%. WF-2 (2020 COVID crash): 77.0%. WF-3 (2021 strong bull): 76.5%. WF-4 (2022 bear): 73.3%. Total degradation over 4 out-of-sample years: 4.0pp. This is still within the normal range — the quality filter continues to hold across bull, crash, recovery, and bear regimes. |
| 3 | **All 12 months profitable — most consistent monthly record across all WF windows** | Jan: Rs 45.8K, Feb: Rs 63.0K, Mar: Rs 51.1K, Apr: Rs 93.3K, May: Rs 69.5K, Jun: Rs 43.5K, Jul: Rs 45.5K, Aug: Rs 71.9K, Sep: Rs 12.8K, Oct: Rs 60.0K, Nov: Rs 38.0K, Dec: Rs 24.3K. Best: April (geopolitical peak = high intraday ranges). Weakest: September (pre-Oct recovery chop). Zero losing months in a full bear year. |
| 4 | **50.2% TARGET_HIT rate — highest across all 4 WF windows** | 124 of 247 trades hit the exact price target. Bear markets create wider intraday ranges (high VIX) where SHORT targets are reached faster. This contrasts with WF-3 2021 bull (fewer exact hits, more time-exits) — confirming regime affects time-to-target, not direction. |
| 5 | **CAMARILLA dominant at 37.2% of all trades (92/247)** | CAMARILLA was the driver in 92 trades — more than the next 3 strategies combined. In bear markets with wide daily ranges, Camarilla levels act as precise intraday resistance for SHORT entries. Confirmed now across WF-2 (2020), WF-3 (2021), and WF-4 (2022) as the flagship strategy. |
| 6 | **FAILED-BO elevated at 13.8% (34/247) — bear market breakout failures** | In bull years, breakout attempts often succeeded; in 2022's bear market, upward breakout attempts routinely failed and reversed. FAILED-BO SHORT signals thrived in this environment. The strategy's elevated driver count in 2022 (vs. bull years) validates its regime-sensitivity. |
| 7 | **CPR at 11.3% (28/247) — gaining driver importance in high-VIX environment** | CPR-based SHORT entries accounted for 11.3% of trades. The strategy uses previous-day CPR levels as intraday resistance — in volatile 2022 sessions, stocks frequently opened above CPR then failed at it. CPR has grown as a driver from WF-2 → WF-3 → WF-4, tracking rising market volatility. |
| 8 | **FIRST-CANDLE at 15.8% (39/247) despite wt_long=0.10 suppression** | FIRST-CANDLE was the second-most-common driver despite being weight-suppressed (wt_short=3.0 but wt_long=0.10). On SHORT side, the strategy's high wt_short compensates. 15.8% driver rate confirms FIRST-CANDLE is a top-3 SHORT driver in the system but remains suppressed on the LONG side from Phase 2A underperformance. |
| 9 | **Computer restart during run — log vs parquet discrepancy** | Session log showed 71 trades / Rs 121,033 (second session only). Parquet confirms 247 trades / Rs 618,792 (complete year, no date duplicates). This is an architectural note: `run_year()` year-summary only counts trades from the current Python session, not total year from checkpoint. The parquet + checkpoint-resume correctly handled the restart. |
| 10 | **WF-5 ready — 4/5 windows confirmed positive, gate is 4/5** | WF-1 PASS (Rs 6.77L), WF-2 PASS (Rs 9.10L), WF-3 PASS (Rs 7.17L), WF-4 PASS (Rs 6.19L). Gate condition of 4/5 windows positive is ALREADY MET. WF-5 tests 2023-2026 (post-bear recovery + live period). Next: `python run_analysis.py 2022` → `python scripts/wf_freeze.py --window 5` → `python run_testing.py 2023 --wf-window 5`. |


## Somal finding: CPR targets are verythin (observed in Shorts trades) even though hitting the target we are getting negative returns we should think whether CPR should be driver of any trade or pass the steering to next best strategy

## Year 2022 Summary
- Total trades        : 247 (0 LONG, 247 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 139 (56.3%)  — price reached target
- Profitable exits    : 55 (22.3%)  — TIME_EXIT with positive P&L
- Losses              : 53 (21.5%)  — stopped out or negative exit
- Effective win rate  : 78.5%
- Total P&L           : Rs 818,497  (Long Rs 0 | Short Rs 818,497)

### WF-5 (2023) Findings — 5 Key Points

| # | Finding | Detail |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Win rate held at 65.3% but P&L halved (Rs 8.19L → Rs 4.09L) — exact hits explain it** | Exact target hits dropped from 56.3% (2022) to 27.3% (2023). Time exits rose from 22.3% to 38.0%. The system stayed directionally correct but 2023's recovery bull market (Nifty +20%) meant SHORT measured-move targets were rarely reached before intraday reversal. Per-trade P&L: Rs 3,315 (2022) → Rs 1,669 (2023). System is profitable but capturing only partial moves. |
| 2 | **CAMARILLA collapsed 66.5% → 47.0% — confirmed regime-sensitive, weakest in recovery markets** | WF-2 (2020 crash): strong. WF-3 (2021 bull): held. WF-4 (2022 bear): 66.5% dominant. WF-5 (2023 recovery): 47.0%, below 50%. In recovery/bull markets, H3 resistance levels break upward more often — H3-rejection SHORT signals fail systematically. CAMARILLA is a bear/volatile-market SHORT driver, not a universal one. Do not rely on it as flagship in bull years. |
| 3 | **VWAP-REV (0.0% WR) and VWAP-STDDEV (13.3% WR) — mean-reversion shorts non-functional in trending market** | VWAP-REV fired 7 SHORT signals, won 0. VWAP-STDDEV fired 49 signals, won only 7. In a +20% Nifty recovery year, stocks extended above VWAP stayed above VWAP — the reversion thesis failed. These two strategies should have wt_short suppressed in future WF cycles when 2023 data feeds back into training. |
| 4 | **INTRADAY-STRUCT best-performing BEST-tier strategy at 54.0% — price structure more regime-resilient than indicators** | In WF-4 (2022 bear): 68.2%. In WF-5 (2023 recovery): 54.0%. Dropped less than any other BEST strategy. LHLL patterns naturally become rarer in a recovering market so fewer signals fire, but the ones that do are cleaner. Indicator-based strategies (RSI-EXT 31%, BOLLINGER 43%, ADX-FILTER 42%) degraded far more. |
| 5 | **Zero LONG trades across all 245 trades — long weights suppressed from bear training, Nifty +20% opportunity missed** | Every trade in 2023 WF-5 test was SHORT. Long weights entering 2023 were heavily suppressed (most at 0.10–0.50) from 2022 bear training. With Nifty recovering +20% in 2023, the system had zero long exposure — a significant opportunity cost. This is the structural cost of the bear-year weight suppression carrying forward. Expect long weight recovery only after bull years re-enter the training window. |
| 6 | **FIRST-CANDLE dominated 2023 at ~78% of all SHORT trades — the most suppressed LONG strategy became the #1 SHORT driver** | Driver breakdown from log: FIRST-CANDLE=239, DESC-TRI=22, SUPERTREND=11, STOCHASTIC=10, VPOC=8, FAILED-BO=8, BEAR-ENGULF=4, CPR=2, RISE-WEDGE=1. FIRST-CANDLE has wt_long=0.10 (lowest in system, historically suppressed) but wt_short=3.0 (maximum). In 2023, individual stocks showed bearish opening candles even as Nifty recovered overall — FIRST-CANDLE's 09:15–09:30 SHORT signal fired repeatedly at the maximum short weight, crowding out all other drivers. Compare: 2022 CAMARILLA dominated at 37.2% (92/247). FIRST-CANDLE at ~78% is the most concentrated driver dominance in the system's history. **Risk:** Entire 2023 P&L (Rs 4.09L) is FIRST-CANDLE dependent — if this strategy deteriorates, 2023 results collapse. Monitor closely in WF-5 extended years (2024–2026). |

## Year 2024 WF5 Testing Results (Frozen WF5 Weights)

- Total trades        : 248 (0 LONG, 248 SHORT)
- Exact target hits   : 64 (25.8%)  — price reached 2× target
- Profitable exits    : 86 (34.7%)  — TIME_EXIT with positive P&L
- Losses              : 98 (39.5%)  — stopped out or TIME_EXIT at loss
- Effective win rate  : 60.5%
- Total P&L           : Rs 4,50,390  (Long Rs 0 | Short Rs 4,50,390)

*Note: Phase 2 (adaptive weights) 2024 run produced Rs 5,70,367 at 50.4% WR. WF5 frozen weights produce LOWER P&L but HIGHER win rate — better quality trades, fewer large wins inflated by adaptive sizing.*

### Driver Distribution — 2024 WF5

| Driver        | Trades | TH  | WIN | LOSS | WR%   | P&L         | Share |
|---------------|--------|-----|-----|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| FIRST-CANDLE  | 189    | 51  | 94  | 44   | 76.7% | Rs 3,56,608 | 76.2% |
| FAILED-BO     | 18     |  6  |  7  |  5   | 72.2% | Rs   62,145 |  7.3% |
| DESC-TRI      | 15     |  0  | 15  |  0   | 100%* | Rs  −5,827  |  6.0% |
| VPOC          | 10     |  5  |  2  |  3   | 70.0% | Rs   41,227 |  4.0% |
| BEAR-ENGULF   |  9     |  1  |  4  |  4   | 55.6% | Rs    6,766 |  3.6% |
| CAMARILLA     |  3     |  1  |  1  |  1   | 66.7% | Rs    1,178 |  1.2% |
| SUPERTREND    |  3     |  0  |  2  |  1   | 66.7% | Rs   −3,476 |  1.2% |
| STOCHASTIC    |  1     |  0  |  0  |  1   |  0.0% | Rs   −8,232 |  0.4% |

*DESC-TRI 100% "win" is misleading — all 15 are TIME_EXIT but net P&L is negative because exits are tiny and costs erode the gain. Target was never hit. Effectively a losing strategy as driver.*

### 2024 WF5 Key Findings

**FINDING 1 — FIRST-CANDLE dominance confirmed and profitable**
FIRST-CANDLE drove 76.2% of all 2024 trades (189/248) — consistent with 78% in 2023. Total P&L contribution: Rs 3,56,608 (79% of all profit). WR 76.7% with 51 exact target hits.
E01 experiment (June 2026) blocked FIRST-CANDLE as driver for 2023 — P&L collapsed 73% (Rs 4,08,994 → Rs 1,07,721). Confirmed: FIRST-CANDLE dominance is the engine working correctly, not a flaw.
**Rule:** Do not block or suppress FIRST-CANDLE as driver. Its 65% lifetime WR is genuinely earned.

**FINDING 2 — CAMARILLA and VPOC have almost disappeared as drivers**
2023 Phase 2: CAMARILLA 71 driver trades, VPOC 71 driver trades.
2024 WF5: CAMARILLA 3 driver trades, VPOC 10 driver trades.
This is because under WF5 frozen weights (wt_long=3.0, wt_short=3.0 for both), the composite score competition is tighter and FIRST-CANDLE out-scores them on more days. These strategies still fire as agreement voters but rarely win the driver election.
**Rule:** CAMARILLA and VPOC results from Phase 2 (2024) analysis are not comparable to WF5 testing. Don't apply Phase 2 per-strategy rules to WF5 runs.

**FINDING 3 — FAILED-BO is the reliable second driver under WF5 (18 trades, 72.2% WR)**
18 trades, Rs 62,145 P&L, 72.2% win rate. Best non-FIRST-CANDLE performer.
**Rule for 2025 WF5 testing:** When FAILED-BO is driver, it is a high-quality signal. Do not down-weight.

**FINDING 4 — DESC-TRI as driver is a value destroyer despite 100% nominal win rate**
15 trades, all TIME_EXIT, zero targets hit, net P&L Rs −5,827. The 100% "win rate" is an artifact of never hitting stop (small position move) but also never reaching target. Each trade bleeds transaction costs.
**Rule:** DESC-TRI should be added to DRIVER_BLOCKED. It can vote on composite score but must not set entry/stop/target. Only the direction call is valid, not the measured move.

**FINDING 5 — WF5 frozen weights outperform adaptive weights on win rate (+10pp) in 2024**
Phase 2 adaptive 2024: 50.4% WR, Rs 5,70,367.
WF5 frozen 2024: 60.5% WR, Rs 4,50,390.
P&L is lower under WF5 because adaptive weights had learned 2024 patterns mid-year (circular). Win rate is higher under WF5 because frozen weights prevent over-adaptation to noise. The WF5 result is the honest out-of-sample number.

**FINDING 6 — System P&L growing year-over-year on WF5 frozen weights**
2023 WF5: Rs 4,08,994 (245 trades, 65.3% WR)
2024 WF5: Rs 4,50,390 (248 trades, 60.5% WR)
Year-over-year P&L +10% despite win rate falling 4.8pp. The SHORT side is structurally profitable on frozen WF5 weights. The engine does not need retraining to remain profitable.

### 2025 WF5 Key Findings

**FINDING 1 — FIRST-CANDLE dominance stable across 3 years**
76.7% of 2025 trades driven by FIRST-CANDLE (191/249), virtually unchanged from 76.2% in 2024 and 78% in 2023. P&L contribution Rs 3,42,435 (69% of total). Effective WR of 63.4% across 191 trades is statistically robust.
**Rule:** FIRST-CANDLE must remain unrestricted as driver. Its consistent 3-year dominance is structural, not noise.

**FINDING 2 — FAILED-BO confirmed as best secondary driver**
14 trades, 78.6% effective WR, Rs 87,422 total, avg Rs 6,244 per trade. Highest per-trade value of any driver. Consistent with 2024 (18 trades, 72.2% WR, Rs 62,145).
**Rule:** FAILED-BO is a quality signal. Do not down-weight. If trading multiple positions per day, FAILED-BO entry is a strong candidate for second slot.

**FINDING 3 — DESC-TRI confirmed as driver value-destroyer (2nd year)**
2024: 15 trades, 0 target hits, Rs −5,827. 2025: 11 trades, 0 target hits, Rs −5,420. Across both years: 26 trades, zero target hits, Rs −11,247 net. All exits are TIME_EXIT — the measured move is never reached.
**Rule:** Add DESC-TRI to DRIVER_BLOCKED immediately. It is valid as a voter for composite score but cannot set entry/stop/target. The direction call is correct; the target distance is not.

**FINDING 4 — Late-day entry degradation confirmed for 2nd year**
Target hit rate by entry time slot:
- 09:xx: 194 trades → 30.9% target hit rate
- 10:xx: 30 trades → 16.7% target hit rate
- 11:xx: 14 trades → 7.1% target hit rate
- 12:xx+: 11 trades → 0.0% target hit rate
Every hour later cuts the target hit probability roughly in half. No trade entering at 12:00 or later hit its target in all of 2025.
**Rule:** Consider hard cutoff at 11:30 for new short entries (already have 14:00 cutoff; move to 11:30 for investigation).

**FINDING 5 — September is structurally the weakest month**
Sep 2025: 22 trades, 45.5% effective WR, Rs 13,982 — lowest WR of any month. Sep 2024 also showed similar weakness. Post-monsoon sector rotation and FII repositioning likely cause short setups to be less reliable.
**Rule:** Note seasonal weakness in September. No rule change needed, but monitor Sep regime closely.

### Monthly P&L — 2026 WF5

| Month    | Trades | Eff WR% | P&L      |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Jan 2026 |  20    |  60.0%  | Rs  25,286 |

### 2026 WF5 Key Findings

**FINDING 1 — FIRST-CANDLE dominance unchanged for 4th consecutive year**
77.6% of trades (90/116) driven by FIRST-CANDLE. Year-on-year: 78% (2023) → 76.2% (2024) → 76.7% (2025) → 77.6% (2026). Structurally locked in across all market regimes.
**Rule:** FIRST-CANDLE dominance is a permanent feature of the SHORT engine, not drift. Do not fight it.

**FINDING 2 — VPOC re-emerged as meaningful second driver**
7 trades, 71.4% eff WR, Rs 26,629, avg Rs 3,804. VPOC had fallen to marginal status in 2024-25 under score competition. In 2026 it recovered to #2 by trades. FAILED-BO (4 trades, 75% WR, avg Rs 3,228) and BEAR-ENGULF (5 trades, 80% WR) also performing well.
**Rule:** The secondary driver slot rotates between VPOC / FAILED-BO / BEAR-ENGULF depending on regime. All three have consistently positive WR across 4 years — do not suppress any of them.

**FINDING 3 — DESC-TRI: only 1 trade in 2026 (inconclusive), but 2-year block case is strong**
2024: 15 trades, 0 TH, Rs −5,827. 2025: 11 trades, 0 TH, Rs −5,420. 2026: 1 trade, 0 TH, Rs +1,505 (only TIME_EXIT profit). Across 3 years: 27 driver trades, zero target hits, net Rs −9,742.
**Rule:** Block DESC-TRI as driver now. The 2026 single positive TIME_EXIT does not change the 0/27 target-hit record. Add to DRIVER_BLOCKED before WF6 training.

**FINDING 4 — SUPERTREND weak in 2026**
3 trades, 0% effective WR, Rs −6,794, avg Rs −2,265. Consistent with 2025 (8 trades, 62.5% WR but lowest avg PnL). 2026 SUPERTREND as driver is trending weaker — worth monitoring.
**Rule:** No block yet (small sample), but flag for WF6 review if trend continues.

**FINDING 5 — Late-day degradation confirmed for 3rd consecutive year**
Target hit rate by entry time: 09:xx = 33.7%, 10:xx = 6.7%, 11:xx = 0.0%, 12:xx+ = 0.0%.
Zero target hits from 11:00 onwards for the third year running (2024, 2025, 2026 all show same pattern).
**Rule:** Hard cutoff at 11:30 for new SHORT entries is now supported by 3-year evidence. Implement before live deployment.

**FINDING 6 — WF5 complete: 4-year cumulative result**
2023 WF5: Rs 4,08,994 (245 trades, 65.3% WR)
2024 WF5: Rs 4,50,390 (248 trades, 60.5% WR)
2025 WF5: Rs 4,94,961 (249 trades, 63.9% WR)
2026 WF5: Rs 2,19,999 (116 trades, 62.9% WR — partial year)
4-year cumulative: Rs 15,74,345 across 858 trades at 63.1% effective WR. All 4 years profitable. WF5 gate passed. Annualised 2026 run-rate (~Rs 4,40,000) is within the prior 3-year band. Engine is structurally sound.
